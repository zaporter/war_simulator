# War Card Game Simulator

In order to settle a dispute, I have created this super simple simulator for the card game "War". I have followed the [bicycle cards rules](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/) when implementing this game. 


This has lead to the following stats after running 10000 games:

Mean rounds per game = 178.0

Stddev of rounds per game = 135.98

Mean wars per game = 13.3

Probability that player1 will win: 0.4955


Similarly, we can create the following histogram for the number of rounds to expect to play for a game:
